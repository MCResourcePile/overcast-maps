# Contributing to overcast-maps

The repository (overcast-maps) is for Minecraft maps that are in the Overcast Network map repository which were featured on the oc.tc website and PGM servers. Maps that were created for the Overcast Network but did not make it to the repository are to be submitted to [overcast-unofficial-maps](https://github.com/MCResourcePile/overcast-unofficial-maps), not here.

Before submitting your map to this repository, if you can, please load and test your map and XML on the latest version of CardinalPGM to observe if it behaves as intended. Maps that are in the Overcast Network map repository **AND** work correctly with CardinalPGM must be submitted to [overcast-cardinal-maps](https://github.com/MCResourcePile/overcast-cardinal-maps). Unofficial Overcast Network maps that work with CardinalPGM are **not** to be submitted in the `overcast-cardinal-maps` repository.

Please only submit the most recent version of your map which is in the Overcast Network repository as this version is almost guaranteed not to have any outstanding issues. If you cannot retrieve this version one of our staff with access to the full repository will be able to supply the download.

For your map to be displayed on our website you must also create a pull request on our [website repository](https://github.com/MCResourcePile/MCResourcePile.github.io) following these [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/MCResourcePile/MCResourcePile.github.io/blob/source/CONTRIBUTING.md#contributions-to-mapstack).
